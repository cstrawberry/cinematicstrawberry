        <h1>Subjective Coherence: A Novel Framework for Understanding Local Consistency and Global Inconsistency in
            Human Cognition and Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This paper introduces the novel concept of <strong>subjective coherence</strong>, presenting a
            paradigm-shifting framework that reconciles the paradox of locally consistent yet globally inconsistent
            decision-making in human cognition. Extending beyond traditional bounded rationality theories, this
            framework offers a more nuanced understanding of human decision processes. We explore the implications of
            subjective coherence for artificial intelligence (AI) development, arguing that integrating this concept
            into AI design represents a significant advancement toward creating systems capable of navigating complex,
            dynamic environments with human-like flexibility and robustness.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Classical decision theories have long posited that rational agents exhibit consistent, transitive
            preferences, leading to globally coherent decision-making patterns. However, empirical observations reveal
            that human decision-making often displays context-dependent choices, challenging these traditional notions.
            This paper introduces the novel concept of <strong>subjective coherence</strong>, a theoretical framework
            that reconciles the apparent contradiction between local consistency and global inconsistency in human
            cognition.</p>

        <p class="caption">Universe 00110000</p>
        <p>The novelty of our approach lies in its departure from traditional models of rationality and bounded
            rationality. While previous theories have acknowledged limitations in human decision-making, they have
            generally treated inconsistencies as deviations from an ideal rational model. In contrast, our framework
            posits that these "inconsistencies" are fundamental features of adaptive cognition, enabling flexible
            responses to complex, dynamic environments.</p>

        <h2>2. Core Concepts and Definitions</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Local Consistency</h3>
        <p>Local consistency is defined as the optimization of decisions within a specific context, taking into account
            immediate environmental constraints and cognitive limitations. This concept transcends simple
            context-dependence by encompassing the notion that decisions are locally rational given the current
            cognitive and environmental state.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Global Inconsistency</h3>
        <p>Global inconsistency refers to the emergence of contradictions or violations of transitive preferences when
            examining a series of locally consistent decisions across different contexts or time points. This phenomenon
            reflects the dynamic nature of human preferences and the influence of changing contexts on decision-making
            processes.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Subjective Coherence</h3>
        <p>We introduce <strong>subjective coherence</strong> as a novel theoretical construct that describes the
            perceived overall coherence in decision-making, despite the presence of global inconsistencies. Subjective
            coherence captures the individual's sense of logical consistency in their choices, even when analyzed from
            an external, global perspective.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Non-Transitive Preferences</h3>
        <p>Non-transitive preferences are defined as preference orderings that violate the transitivity axiom of
            classical rationality (i.e., if A > B and B > C, then A > C does not necessarily hold). Our framework posits
            that non-transitive preferences are not merely errors or biases but can serve adaptive functions in complex
            decision environments.</p>

        <h3>2.5 Examples</h3>
        <p><strong>2.5.1 Color Preference</strong>: Consider the preferences: <strong>Blue > Green</strong>,
            <strong>Green > Red</strong>, <strong>Red > Blue</strong>. These preferences may be based on different
            contextual motivations such as mood, situational demands, or environmental influences, leading to
            non-transitive ordering.</p>
        <p><strong>2.5.2 Food Preference</strong>: Another example includes preferences like <strong>Salad >
                Pizza</strong>, <strong>Pizza > Sushi</strong>, <strong>Sushi > Salad</strong>, reflecting varying
            contexts.</p>

        <h2>3. Theoretical Foundations</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Beyond Bounded Rationality</h3>
        <p>While our framework builds the concept of bounded rationality, we argue that subjective coherence represents
            a significant theoretical advancement. Unlike bounded rationality, which often treats cognitive limitations
            as constraints on an ideal rational process, subjective coherence posits that local consistency coupled with
            global inconsistency is an adaptive feature of human cognition. This enables flexible responses to complex,
            dynamic environments, enhancing overall decision-making effectiveness.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Cognitive Dissonance and Subjective Coherence</h3>
        <p>We propose a novel integration of cognitive dissonance theory with subjective coherence, highlighting their
            differences and complementary roles. Cognitive dissonance drives individuals to resolve discomfort from
            contradictory beliefs to restore consistency. In contrast, subjective coherence views local inconsistencies
            as adaptive, focusing on maintaining a coherent self-view without resolving every contradiction. This
            approach emphasizes flexibility, while cognitive dissonance emphasizes resolving conflicts to achieve
            psychological comfort.</p>

        <h2>4. Implications for Artificial Intelligence</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Limitations of Classical AI Systems</h3>
        <p>Traditional AI systems often aim for global consistency and logical coherence. This approach may limit
            adaptability and fail to capture the nuanced, context-dependent nature of human decision-making. Such
            systems can become rigid, struggling to operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments where
            flexibility is paramount.</p>
       
        <h3>4.2 Integrating Subjective Coherence into AI</h3>

        <p>We suggest modifications to existing AI architectures that allow for the evolution of preferences over time
            and across contexts. </p>

        <p>We are conceptualizing choices as nodes in a dynamic decision network. By mapping decision-making moments as
            interconnected nodes, we can examine the flow of decisions over time and across varying contexts,
            highlighting how local rationality contributes to overall subjective coherence despite global
            inconsistencies.</p>

        <p>By embedding subjective coherence principles, AI systems can better navigate complex environments by
            prioritizing local consistency while managing global inconsistencies. This leads to more robust and flexible
            AI agents capable of handling real-world complexities.</p>

        <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This paper introduces <strong>subjective coherence</strong> as a novel framework for understanding human
            decision-making and advancing artificial intelligence. By reconciling local consistency with global
            inconsistency, our approach offers a more nuanced and realistic model of cognition. Future research should
            explore empirical validations of subjective coherence in diverse decision-making scenarios and further
            investigate its applications in AI system design to fully realize its transformative potential.</p>
