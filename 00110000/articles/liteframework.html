        <h1>LITE: Dynamic Self-Reference in Peano Arithmetic</h1>
        <hr />

        <!-- =================== ABSTRACT =================== -->
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Look In The Eye (<strong>LITE</strong>) framework demonstrates how a
            system within Peano Arithmetic (PA) can exhibit a dynamic, evolving
            self-referential structure. By leveraging strong self-reference techniques
            (via the Recursion Theorem) and bounded proof searches (formalized within
            PA), LITE reveals a feedback mechanism in which an arithmetical function
            <em>updates</em> its values upon discovering new proofs or refutations
            about its own behavior. This iterative mechanism challenges the notion that
            formal arithmetic is merely static, showing instead that PA can support
            unfolding, adaptive processes guided by proof discoveries. LITE thus
            broadens our perspective on definability, self-reference, and how
            “mathematics can respond to itself” through a carefully orchestrated
            interplay of function definitions and proof predicates.
        </p>

        <!-- =================== INTRO SECTION =================== -->
        <h2>1. Introduction: Understanding LITE</h2>

        <h3>1.1. The Traditional View: Formal Arithmetic as Static</h3>
        <p>
            Historically, many areas of mathematics—such as dynamical systems, ergodic theory,
            and chaos theory—have dealt extensively with evolving or changing phenomena.
            However, <em>within</em> the framework of <strong>formal arithmetic</strong>
            (like Peano Arithmetic), the standard approach has often been seen as “static”:
            once definitions, axioms, and theorems are established, their logical status
            does not spontaneously shift in response to newly discovered proofs
            <em>about</em> those very definitions. In other words, arithmetic does not
            typically include a built-in mechanism that causes the system itself to
            “recompute” or “update” function values based on fresh derivations.
        </p>
        <p>
            By focusing on <strong>dynamic self-reference</strong> specifically in
            Peano Arithmetic, the <strong>LITE</strong> framework aims to show that we
            can incorporate a kind of “feedback loop” directly into the definition
            of an arithmetical function—without adding new axioms or stepping outside
            classical PA. This approach neither denies nor contradicts the broader
            history of mathematics involving evolving processes; rather, it highlights
            how even a traditionally “static” formal theory can be made to adapt its
            outputs when short proofs about its own behavior appear.
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
            <li><strong>Static Tradition in PA:</strong> Traditional treatments of
                formal arithmetic seldom integrate a mechanism to automatically change
                function values in light of new proofs about those functions, keeping
                definitions fixed once given.</li>
            <li><strong>Contrast with Other Fields:</strong> In dynamical systems,
                geometry, or even certain parts of proof theory, “change” and iteration
                are commonplace. This paper shows a parallel possibility inside
                <em>Peano Arithmetic</em> itself.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The LITE Perspective:</strong> By constructing a function
                that checks for short proofs of statements referencing its own code,
                LITE bridges the gap between “static” arithmetical foundations and the
                adaptive spirit found in other branches of mathematics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2. A Fresh Angle on Self-Reference</h3>
        <p>
            Classical Gödelian self-reference focuses on the existence of certain
            sentences (“I am not provable in PA”) whose truth and provability
            statuses intertwine in profound ways. LITE extends this tradition by
            allowing <em>infinitely many</em> self-referential statements—one for
            each natural number input—and by making the function’s value at each step
            sensitive to whether these statements (or their negations) are
            provably derivable within specific bounded lengths:
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
            <li><strong>Iterative Aspect:</strong> At each input <span class="code">n</span>,
                LITE inspects a statement <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> referencing
                the function itself and checks (within a fixed proof-length bound)
                for a derivation of <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> or its negation.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Definition:</strong> If either is found, the function
                <span class="code">f(n)</span> “shifts” in a prescribed manner. If not,
                it follows a default path.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Self-Reference:</strong> Because <span class="code">f</span> can
                change, new proofs that appear down the line may further alter its
                trajectory, creating a fully <em>iterative</em> feedback loop.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In bridging the power of the Recursion Theorem with bounded searches for
            proofs, LITE creates a genuinely adaptive structure. Instead of a single
            diagonal that remains inert, LITE’s approach is to generate a family of
            statements whose provability shapes the next stage of
            <span class="code">f</span>’s definition.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3. What This Means for Arithmetic</h3>
        <p>
            LITE reveals that arithmetic can “listen” to whether a statement about
            itself is provable (or refutable) within specific short-proof bounds,
            then incorporate that discovery into its own next step. This viewpoint
            transforms our usual conception of arithmetic:
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
            <li><strong>From Static to Dynamic:</strong> The values of
                <span class="code">f(n)</span> are not predetermined by a closed-form
                or fixed recursion; instead, they can adapt in real time as proofs
                emerge.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Embedding Feedback Loops:</strong> By referencing its own
                code and bounding proof lengths, <span class="code">f</span> exemplifies
                a system that self-monitors and self-updates, all within standard PA.</li>
            <li><strong>Richer Self-Reference:</strong> Unlike single-shot sentences,
                we now have an entire sequence of self-referential statements guiding
                these internal changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The sections below lay out how LITE is formally constructed, the
            mathematical details that ensure its consistency, and why it broadens
            the frontier of arithmetical definability and self-reference.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
            <h4>Beyond Static Self-Reference</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Classical Approach:</strong> Self-referential statements
                often revolve around fixed claims, like “I am not provable.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>LITE’s Perspective:</strong> Multiple, input-indexed
                statements feed back into the value of a function <em>within</em>
                arithmetic, creating an ongoing interplay between proof discovery
                and numeric outputs.

        <!-- =================== PRELIMINARIES =================== -->
        <h2>2. Mathematical Foundation</h2>

        <h3>2.1. Peano Arithmetic and Gödel Encoding</h3>
        <p>
            LITE rests on classical <strong>Peano Arithmetic (PA)</strong>.
            Its language comprises symbols for 0, successor
            (<span class="code">S(⋅)</span>), addition, multiplication, and
            ordering, along with the usual logical machinery. Through
            <em>Gödel numbering</em>, every finite string (be it a formula or
            proof) is encoded as a natural number:
        </p>
        <ol style="font-size: 18px;">
            <li><strong>Gödel Coding:</strong> A bijection
                <span class="code">⟨·⟩: Σ* → ℕ</span> assigns unique codes
                to expressions, enabling arithmetic to speak about syntactic objects
                numerically.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Provability Predicate
                    <span class="code">Prf(p, ⌈ψ⌉)</span>:</strong> Within PA,
                this relation asserts that <span class="code">p</span> is the code
                of a valid proof of <span class="code">ψ</span>. This is key for
                referencing “whether ψ can be proven in PA.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            With this apparatus, statements in arithmetic can <em>self-reflect</em>:
            they can contain references to codes of formulae and proofs, including
            statements about the function <span class="code">f</span> we aim to define.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2. Bounded Proof Search via g(n)</h3>
        <p>
            Central to LITE is the notion of checking for a proof within a specific
            size bound, controlled by a fast-growing function
            <span class="code">g(n)</span>:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            ∃p ≤ g(n) <strong>Prf</strong>(p, ⌈ψ⌉).
        </p>
        <p>
            Although potentially huge, <span class="code">g(n)</span> remains
            finite for each <span class="code">n</span>, so there is no paradox
            in “looking for all proofs up to length <span class="code">g(n)</span>.”
            If none exist, the search terminates without success; if a short proof
            does exist, it is eventually identified. This bounding technique makes
            the entire process definable <em>inside</em> PA and ensures that
            checking these proofs does not require stepping outside the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            By coupling <span class="code">g(n)</span> with the function we
            define, LITE effectively “asks” at each stage whether certain
            statements can be proven (or refuted) under that growing size
            limit. This local proof search is the engine of the dynamic update
            process.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3. The Recursion Theorem</h3>
        <p>
            An essential ingredient is the
            <strong>Recursion Theorem</strong>, which guarantees that a function
            can validly reference its own code without inconsistency. In simpler
            terms, it states that for any total computable operator
            <span class="code">Ψ(α,n)</span>, there is a code
            <span class="code">β</span> such that the partial computable function
            <span class="code">ϕ<sub>β</sub></span> satisfies:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            ϕ<sub>β</sub>(n) = Ψ(β, n).
        </p>
        <p>
            By interpreting <span class="code">β</span> as the “code of
            <span class="code">f</span>,” we obtain a legitimate self-referential
            definition: <span class="code">f</span> can talk about <span class="code">f</span>. In LITE, this theorem
            underpins how
            <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> can explicitly mention
            <span class="code">f(n)</span>, enabling the dynamic interplay between
            proof discovery and numeric values.
        </p>

        <!-- =================== DEFINING LITE =================== -->
        <h2>3. Dynamic Self-Reference in LITE</h2>

        <h3>3.1. Main Construction</h3>
        <p>
            At the heart of LITE is a function
            <span class="code">f: ℕ → ℕ</span> defined via:
        </p>
        <pre style="font-size: 18px;">
f(n) =
  { n + H<sub>1</sub>(n), if ∃p ≤ g(n) Prf(p, ⌈ϕ(n)⌉);
    n + H<sub>2</sub>(n), if ∃p ≤ g(n) Prf(p, ⌈¬ϕ(n)⌉);
    n + 1,               otherwise. }
    </pre>
        <p>
            Here, <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> is a statement <em>about</em>
            <span class="code">f</span>, referencing its own Gödel code. The functions
            <span class="code">H<sub>1</sub>(n)</span> and
            <span class="code">H<sub>2</sub>(n)</span> are chosen to ensure
            a noticeable “jump” if a proof is found. If neither <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> nor its negation is
            proven within size
            <span class="code">g(n)</span>, then
            <span class="code">f(n) = n + 1</span> by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of the Recursion Theorem, there is no contradiction in
            letting <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> refer to “the value of
            <span class="code">f(n)</span>,” even though
            <span class="code">f</span> is simultaneously being defined by
            this piecewise rule. This yields a consistent, total function
            <span class="code">f</span> inside PA that “listens” for short proofs
            about itself.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2. Shifting Values Based on Proof Discovery</h3>
        <p>
            The novelty lies in how <span class="code">f(n)</span> is not
            predetermined by a simple recursive or closed-form expression.
            Instead, it reacts if a short proof of <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span>
            or <span class="code">¬ϕ(n)</span> emerges within
            <span class="code">g(n)</span>-bounded length. If it does, LITE
            “steers” the function to <span class="code">n + H<sub>1</sub>(n)</span>
            or <span class="code">n + H<sub>2</sub>(n)</span>. Otherwise,
            it leaves <span class="code">f(n)</span> at <span class="code">n + 1</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because <span class="code">n + H<sub>1</sub>(n)</span> or
            <span class="code">n + H<sub>2</sub>(n)</span> can be relatively large
            jumps, subsequent statements <span class="code">ϕ(n+1)</span>,
            <span class="code">ϕ(n+2)</span>, etc., may become provable (or
            refutable) in new ways. Over time, <span class="code">f</span> thus
            evolves under the influence of the system’s ability to locate
            relevant derivations, effectively “recording” the discovery
            of short proofs in its numeric output.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3. Feedback Over the Natural Numbers</h3>
        <p>
            By design, each <span class="code">n</span> extends the conversation:
            “Is <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> provable up to length
            <span class="code">g(n)</span>? Is <span class="code">¬ϕ(n)</span> provable up to length
            <span class="code">g(n)</span>?” This ongoing check seeds
            an <em>iterative feedback loop</em> throughout the natural numbers.
            No single instance “locks in” the entire behavior forever; instead,
            each step can bring fresh shifts based on newly accessible
            derivations. This iterative nature is the cornerstone of LITE’s
            dynamic self-reference.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2. Intrinsic Dynamism</h3>
        <p>
            Classic recursive functions remain fixed after definition, but
            <span class="code">f(n)</span> here can shift in response to the
            discovery of short proofs. This “listening” for new derivations
            brings an element of <em>adaptivity</em> not typically associated
            with straightforward recursive definitions.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3. Rich Structure</h3>
        <p>
            Each point <span class="code">n</span> can drastically affect
            future points <span class="code">n+1</span>, <span class="code">n+2</span>,
            etc., by changing the form or provability of statements involving
            <span class="code">f</span>’s subsequent values. This can lead
            to sequences that remain stable for many steps, then undergo large
            jumps once a relevant proof or disproof appears.

        <h3>5.1. Extending Gödel’s Legacy</h3>
        <p>
            Gödel’s incompleteness opened the door to self-reference in arithmetic.
            LITE pushes this further, showcasing how <em>an entire collection</em>
            of self-referential statements—one per input—can collectively govern
            an arithmetical function’s evolving values.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2. Bridging Proof Discovery and Function Values</h3>
        <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
            <li><strong>Local Proof Checks:</strong> Rather than positing
                broad reflection principles, LITE uses bounded statements
                “∃p ≤ g(n) Prf(p, ⌈ϕ(n)⌉)” to modulate <span class="code">f</span> in a tightly controlled manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Unified Formalism:</strong> The entire mechanism
                fits within standard PA with no extra axioms, relying on
                definable proof predicates and the Recursion Theorem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3. Deeper View of Arithmetic’s Expressive Power</h3>
        <p>
            By embedding a “self-rewriting” protocol into a single function,
            LITE underscores that arithmetic can exhibit forms of feedback
            and adaptation once we leverage self-reference carefully. This
            broadens conceptions of what “arithmetical definability” can
            achieve.

        <h3>6.2. Potentially Complex Behavior</h3>
        <p>
            Although <span class="code">f</span> is total, its path can
            exhibit surprising turns when proofs (or disproofs) become
            accessible. Long periods of quiescence may give way to sudden
            large changes if certain short proofs about <span class="code">f</span> appear.
        </p>

        <h3>6.3. Governed by Proof Bounds</h3>

            All stages remain anchored in finite proof searches up to

            grows, allowing the system to glean new insights from previously
            inaccessible derivations. This interplay of “growing bounding
            function” and “iterative self-reference” is the essence of LITE’s
            dynamic flavor.

            <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                <li><strong>Bounding Function:</strong> Define
                    <span class="code">g(n) = 2^(n+1)</span>. This grows sufficiently
                    fast to allow checking for a variety of proofs as <span class="code">n</span>
                    increases, but remains finite for each individual <span class="code">n</span>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Jump Functions:</strong> Let
                    <span class="code">H<sub>1</sub>(n) = 10</span> and
                    <span class="code">H<sub>2</sub>(n) = 20</span>. Thus, whenever a proof
                    of <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> is found,
                    <span class="code">f(n) = n + 10</span>. If a proof of
                    <span class="code">¬ϕ(n)</span> is discovered,
                    <span class="code">f(n) = n + 20</span>. Otherwise, the default is
                    <span class="code">n + 1</span>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Form of <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span>:</strong> For illustrative
                    purposes, suppose
                    <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> asserts that
                    <em>"<span class="code">f</span> eventually takes a value &ge; n + 10."</em>
                    More precisely, <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> says something like
                    "There exists a coding <span class="code">p</span> for a proof
                    &le; 2^(n+1) such that

                    <span class="code">ϕ(0)</span> in just 2 steps, so

        <h2>7. Formal Structure</h2>

        <h3>7.1. Recursion Theorem Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> truly references
            <span class="code">f</span>, one typically constructs a
            computable operator <span class="code">Ψ(α, n)</span>
            that uses <span class="code">α</span> as the code of a function.
            The Recursion Theorem guarantees a fixed point
            <span class="code">β</span> with <span class="code">ϕ<sub>β</sub>(n) = Ψ(β, n)</span>.
            Interpreting <span class="code">β</span> as the code of <span class="code">f</span> completes the
            self-referential loop.
        </p>

        <p>
            In essence, this means our function <span class="code">f</span> can literally
            “read” its own description and incorporate references to its own values
            in the statement <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span>. Crucially, this is performed
            within PA, yielding a self-consistent definition that does not
            overstep the theory’s expressive capabilities.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2. The Proof Predicate</h3>
        <p>
            The definability of <span class="code">Prf(p, ⌈ψ⌉)</span> in PA
            makes it possible for <span class="code">f(n)</span> to incorporate
            checks of whether <span class="code">ψ</span> is proven by a code
            <span class="code">p</span> ≤ <span class="code">g(n)</span>. This
            tight coupling of code, proof, and bounding function ensures
            the entire construction is an internal process in arithmetic.
        </p>

        <h3>7.3. Harmony of Components</h3>
        <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
            <li><strong>Self-Reference:</strong> From the Recursion Theorem.</li>
            <li><strong>Bounded Search:</strong> From <span class="code">∃p ≤ g(n)</span> criteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Function:</strong> From the piecewise rule
                that modifies <span class="code">f(n)</span> based on new proofs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Combined, these yield LITE’s characteristic feedback loop: each
            numeric argument <span class="code">n</span> spurs an inspection
            of short proofs about <span class="code">f(n)</span>, and the outcome
            decides the numeric output.

                    <strong>Definition of the Operator Ψ:</strong>
                    <br />
                    We first specify a total computable operator Ψ(α, n) that
                    carries out the following procedure when given a code α:
                    it interprets α as the description of a function
                    φ<sub>α</sub>, and then defines a value for Ψ(α, n) via
                    the piecewise rule:
                    <pre style="font-size: 18px; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: break-word; max-width: 100%;">
        if (∃p ≤ g(n) such that Prf(p, ⌈"ϕ(n) under code α"⌉)) then output n + H₁(n)
        else if (∃p ≤ g(n) such that Prf(p, ⌈¬"ϕ(n) under code α"⌉)) then output n + H₂(n)
        else output n + 1
                    </pre>
                    where "ϕ(n) under code α" references the would-be value of φ<sub>α</sub>(n).
                    The existence of such a total computable operator Ψ follows from
                    standard methods of representing finite searches and proof predicates in
                    arithmetic.

                <li>
                    <strong>Application of the Recursion Theorem:</strong>
                    <br />
                    By the Recursion Theorem (Kleene's Recursion Theorem), there exists a code
                    β such that the partial computable function
                    φ<sub>β</sub> satisfies:
                    <p class="formula">
                        φ<sub>β</sub>(n) = Ψ(β, n).
                    </p>
                    In other words, φ<sub>β</sub> is the self-referential fixed point:
                    when β is interpreted as "the code for φ<sub>β</sub>,"
                    the definition of φ<sub>β</sub>(n) precisely mirrors the
                    piecewise behavior of the operator Ψ.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identification of β with f:</strong>
                    <br />
                    We then interpret β as the code of our desired function
                    f. By construction:
                    <p class="formula">
                        f(n) = φ<sub>β</sub>(n) = Ψ(β,n).
                    </p>
                    Concretely, this means f can refer to its own code and check
                    whether proofs of "ϕ(n)" or "¬ϕ(n)" exist within
                    the bound g(n).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Finite Proof Search Ensures a Well-Defined Output:</strong>
                    <br />
                    For each n, verifying whether a proof of length ≤ g(n)
                    exists is a finite (albeit possibly large) procedure. One of the
                    following must hold:
                    <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <li>A proof of "ϕ(n)" is found in ≤ g(n) steps.</li>
                        <li>A proof of "¬ϕ(n)" is found in ≤ g(n) steps.</li>
                        <li>Neither is found.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This directly matches one of the branches in the piecewise definition
                    of f(n). Thus, f(n) is always assigned a specific natural number,
                    guaranteeing totality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Absence of Contradiction:</strong>
                    <br />
                    A typical concern with self-reference is the possibility of creating
                    a "Liar paradox" scenario. However, in this construction:
                    <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <li>Each statement "ϕ(n)" is <em>bounded</em> by the search limit
                            g(n). We do not assert unconditionally that "ϕ(n)" is provable
                            or disprovable; instead, we let the existence (or non-existence) of a
                            short proof <em>decide</em> f(n).</li>
                        <li>The Recursion Theorem framework ensures that referencing the code
                            β of f is done consistently, without leading to an
                            unformalizable or contradictory self-reference.</li>
                        <li>Since the definition relies on a finite (though unbounded in n)
                            search, there is no infinite regress and no direct statement of
                            self-contradiction. The function's value is simply <em>determined</em>
                            by the outcome of these local checks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Consequently, no contradiction akin to "This statement is false" arises,
                    preserving consistency within PA.

                    <strong>Conclusion (Totality and Consistency):</strong>
                    <br />
                    Putting these points together:
                    <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <li>The search for proofs up to size g(n) is finite for each n,
                            so exactly one of the three branches in the piecewise definition applies
                            unambiguously.</li>
                        <li>The Recursion Theorem guarantees the self-referential code β
                            yields a well-defined f that can mention its own values via
                            φ<sub>β</sub>. No paradox emerges from this self-reference.</li>
                        <li>Hence, f is total (it has a well-defined natural number output
                            for every n) and does not engender contradiction in PA.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Therefore, f as defined by LITE is both total and consistent with PA,
                    completing the proof.

        <!-- =================== BROADER PERSPECTIVE =================== -->
        <h2>8. Broader Perspective</h2>

        <h3>8.1. From Single Statement to Infinite Family</h3>
        <p>
            Traditional self-reference often hinges on a single statement (Gödel’s
            “I am not provable”). LITE extends this to a structured
            <em>infinite family</em> \(\{\varphi(n)\}\), each referencing a
            different input <span class="code">n</span>, forging a more
            expansive notion of self-reference in arithmetic.
        </p>

        <h3>8.2. Iterative Updates</h3>
        <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
            <li><strong>Ongoing Shifts:</strong> The function <span class="code">f</span> can “evolve” if certain
                statements become
                provable or refutable. This is not a static phenomenon but a
                repeated cycle of introspection.</li>
            <li><strong>Potential Complexity:</strong> Because <span class="code">g(n)</span> grows, the system may
                remain stable
                for many inputs, then jump significantly, exemplifying
                a dynamic continuum seldom explored in elementary arithmetic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8.3. New Interpretations of Self-Reference</h3>
        <p>
            LITE demonstrates that self-reference need not be limited to
            self-negating or self-asserting statements. Instead, it becomes
            a tool for building adaptive structures: a function that
            “consults” the presence or absence of certain proofs about
            itself and reacts accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>8.4. Possible Generalizations</h3>
        <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
            <li><strong>Stronger Theories:</strong> While this construction is
                shown in PA, one can import the same ideas into larger axiomatic
                systems, preserving or amplifying the dynamic feedback loops.</li>
            <li><strong>Variants of g(n):</strong> Different bounding functions
                might yield different patterns of when new proofs become accessible,
                further diversifying the possible behaviors of <span class="code">f</span>.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- =================== CONCLUSION =================== -->
        <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The LITE framework underscores a novel view of self-reference in which
            an arithmetical function <span class="code">f(n)</span> can shift its
            values based on whether short proofs concerning
            <span class="code">ϕ(n)</span> or its negation appear within a bound
            <span class="code">g(n)</span>. In contrast to single-shot Gödelian
            statements, LITE orchestrates a <em>sequence</em> of evolving
            self-referential checks, producing an unfolding chain of potential
            updates across the natural numbers. Each time new derivations are found,
            <span class="code">f</span> is redefined accordingly, weaving a feedback
            loop into the very fabric of arithmetic.
        </p>
        <p>
            By relying solely on standard tools—Gödel coding, the definable proof
            predicate <span class="code">Prf(p, ⌈ψ⌉)</span>, a fast-growing bound
            <span class="code">g(n)</span>, and the Recursion Theorem—this
            construction remains entirely within classical PA. It refutes the
            notion that arithmetic must always be a static discipline; instead,
            LITE reveals that PA can exhibit “liveliness,” adapting to new proof
            discoveries in an ongoing manner. The ramifications touch not just
            on self-reference theory, but on how we conceive the possible
            internal transformations a formal system can undergo. The boundary
            between “the system that states truths” and “the system that adapts
            with those truths” is shown to be far more flexible than typically
            assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, LITE pushes us to recognize that self-reference in
            arithmetic need not be static or singular. With careful constraints
            and bounding, we can build a function that truly “observes” its own
            proofs and adjusts itself accordingly—marking a major step forward
            in understanding the dynamic potentials that lie within
            arithmetic itself.
